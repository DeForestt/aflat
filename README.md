# AFlat
AFlat is a simple, low-level, programming language.  It is designed to give as much freedom as possible to the programmer, and yet at the same time be easy to read and understand.
<br>

## Trust the programmer philosophy
AFlat aims to trust that developers know what they are doing.  It allows and encurages things that many other modern languages do not such as pointer arythmatic, memory managment, and so on.

## Getting started

### Cloning the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeForestt/aflat
```

### Building the project
All that is required to build the project is to run the `make` command.
```bash
cd aflat
make
```

### Creating a new project
Creating a new aflat progect is as simple as running the binary with the command 'make'
```bash
./main make <project_name>
```

### Hello World
The hello world program in aflat is auto-generated by the `make` command.
```c
.needs <io.gs>

int main(){
    print("Hello World!");
    return 0;
};
```

### Building a project
The aflat `make` command will have generated a `build.sh` script that can be run to build the project.
```bash
bash build.sh
```

### Running the project
Run the project with the command `./a.out`

### Array Loop Example
```c
.needs <io>
.needs <Collections>

int main(){
    Array a = newArray(int, 10);
    for{int i = 0;}(i < 10){i = i + 1;}{
        adr pointer = a.at(i);              // adr - is the pointer 'address' key word
        pointer =: i;                       // the =: operator is used to load a value to a pointer
    };

    a.forEach([adr value]=>{
        printInt(value as int);             // the as operator is used to assume the type of a pointer
        return 0;
    });
    return 0;
};
```
