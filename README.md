# AFlat
AFlat is a simple, low-level, programming language.  It is designed to give as much freedom as possible to the programmer, and yet at the same time be easy to read and understand. Please see the [documentation](Docs.md) for the full documentation.  Please see examples in the [examples](https://github.com/DeForestt/aflat-chess.git) Repository.

## Trust the programmer philosophy
AFlat aims to trust that developers know what they are doing.  It allows and encurages things that many other modern languages do not such as pointer arythmatic, memory managment, and so on.

## Getting started

### One Command to rule them all
Install with one command: 
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeForestt/aflat/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Cloning the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeForestt/aflat
```

### Building the project
All that is required to build the project is to create the bin directory and run the `make` command.
please make sure that you have the `make` command installed. `sudo apt install make`
```bash
cd aflat
mkdir bin
make
```
Once the compiler is built, generate the standard library objects:
```bash
./rebuild-libs.sh
```
I suggest creating an alias for main in your bashrc file.
```bash
alias aflat="<aflat bin dir>/main"
```
Or adding the aflat bin to your path.

This readme assumes that the aflat bin directory is in your path or an alias is set.

### Creating a new project
Creating a new aflat progect is as simple as running the binary with the command 'make'
```bash
aflat make <project_name>
```

### Hello World
The hello world program in aflat is auto-generated by the `make` command.
```js
.needs <std>

import * from "io" under io;

int main(){
    io.print("Hello World!");
    return 0;
};
```

### Building a project
The aflat `make` command will have generated an `aflat.cfg` configuration file that tells the built in pacage manager what to build and link the file.
```bash
aflat build
```

### Running the project
Build and run the project with the `aflat run` command.

### Array Loop Example
```js
.needs <std>

import {printInt, printChar} from "io" under io;
import ICollection, Array from "Collections";

int main(){
    Array a = new Array(int, 10);
    for int i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1 {
        adr pointer = a.at(i);              // adr - is the pointer 'address' key word
        pointer =: i;                       // the =: operator is used to load a value to a pointer
    };

    a.forEach([adr value]=> io.printInt(value as int)); // the as operator is used to assume the type of a pointer
	io.printChar('\n');
    return 0;
};
```

## Have fun!
